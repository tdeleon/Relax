# Defining an API Structure

Use Services and Endpoints to define a complex API structure

## Overview

While some REST APIs are simple, many are complex consisting of many different path, parameter, and HTTP method
combinations. The structure will often be nested by one or more levels.

Relax provides a great way to define these complex APIs- making it clear to read while reusing and inheriting as much as
possible.
